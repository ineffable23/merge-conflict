# Merge-conflict

A demonstration of resolving merge conflict. Here I created two branches ```feature1``` and ```feature2``` from the main branch. Then tried to merge the changes into the master branch. This resulted into a merge conflict. Then I resolved the conflict manually by correcting the content and saving it. Commited the changes. Pushed the changes to remote.
